#### Prerequisites:
1. All new code will be first merged in `dev` branch and tested out.
2. If everything looks good, we merge the `dev` branch to `main`.
3. No direct writes to `main` branch will be allowed. That's our release branch so it needs to be stable.
4. Always take fresh pull from `dev` before merging changes.


#### How to suggest new code changes? 

- Clone the repo.
`git clone git@github.com:TheDevExperiment/server.git`

- Create a new branch.
`git checkout -b dev_<your_branch_name>`

- Push your changes to this branch.
- Create a PR to the dev branch.
